# MiniGit

This is a (extremely) simple implementation of a Git version control tool.

## Built-in commands

- `git init`

- `git cat-file <type> <blob_sha>`

- `git hash-object <type> <file_path>`

- `git ls-tree <type> <tree_sha>`

- `git write-tree`

- `git commit-tree <tree_sha> -p <parent_sha> -m <message>`

## Next Steps

Next steps include adding local aliases as `add`, `commit`, and branch creation and
versioning as well.
